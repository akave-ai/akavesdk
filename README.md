# Akave SDK CLI

The **Akave SDK CLI** (`akavesdk`) is a command-line tool designed to streamline interactions with Akave's decentralized storage platform. With this SDK, developers can efficiently manage buckets, upload and download files, and interact with metadata across Akave nodes. It supports both standard API operations and an advanced streaming API for high-performance file management, as well as an IPC API for blockchain-based data operations.

Whether you're building a new integration or managing data across nodes, this SDK provides robust capabilities to help you achieve seamless, scalable storage solutions.

# Akave Node API

The Akave Node API provides a set of gRPC services for interacting with the Akave node. Below is a description of the model and available functions.

### Metadata model
#### Bucket model
- unique identifier for a bucket
    ```go
    type ID [32]byte
    ```
- bucket metadata
    ```go
    type Bucket struct {
      ID        ID
      Name      string
      CreatedAt time.Time
    }
    ```

#### File model
- content identifier for files, chunks and blocks
    ```go
    type CID string
    ```
- unique key to identify a file in the store
    ```go
    type FileID struct {
      BucketID buckets.ID
      Name     string
    }
    ```
- file metadata of a streaming file
    ```go
    type FileMeta struct {
      FileID

      StreamID    uuid.UUID
      RootCID     CID
      Size        int64
      CreatedAt   time.Time
      CommittedAt time.Time
    }
    ```
- streaming file model: metadata + chunks it is made of
    ```go
    type FileV2 struct {
      FileMeta

      Chunks []ChunkMeta
    }
    ```
- chunk metadata
    ```go
    type ChunkMeta struct {
      CID  CID
      Size int64
    }
    ```
- chunk metadata with blocks
    ```go
    type Chunk struct {
      ChunkMeta
      Blocks []Block
    }
    ```
- block metadata
    ```go
    type Block struct {
      CID  CID
      Size int64
    }
    ```

### Bucket API

| Endpoint       | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BucketCreate` | Creates a new bucket. The request sent on a node creates a bucket on this node and shares the fact of creation with all other nodes in the network. |
| `BucketView`   | Retrieves details of a specific bucket.                                                                                                             |
| `BucketList`   | Lists all buckets in the network.                                                                                                                   |
| `BucketDelete` | Deletes a specific bucket. The fact of deletion is shared among all nodes in the network. For now, only *soft delete* is implemented.                       |

### Streaming File API

In streaming API file is split into chunks of 32 MB max size where each chunk contains blocks with data(max size of a block is 1 MB).
SDK, when reading the file, attempts to read at most 32 MB as 1 read operation from the source, then builds a DAG for chunk where root CID of a DAG is chunk CID.
Then SDK creates an upload receipt of the chunk using `FileUploadChunkCreate` api endpoint. Receipt describes where each block should be uploaded to,
as upload of blocks is performed simultaneously on multiple akave nodes. Once the chunk is fully uploaded, the process repeats for other chunks, until the file is fully read.
After that SDK performs "commit" operation(using `FileUploadCommit` endpoint), signaling akave nodes, that upload of given file has finished and passing file root CID.
File root CID is calculated incrementally using chunk CIDs.

|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FileUploadCreate`        | Initiates a file upload. Creates a unique stream-id for the file and stores it together with file data (e.g. fileName, bucket, creation_date). Shares the fact of such storing among all nodes in the network. This unique stream-id is used by the client in further requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `FileUploadChunkCreate`   | Stores the given chunk (cid, size and blocks metadata) and returns the receipt where each block should be uploaded to. Also shares the fact of storing the chunk among all nodes in the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `FileUploadBlock`         | Uploads the given block (block's data) via gRPC streaming to the node address returned in response to **FileUploadChunkCreate**. If the replication is enabled on a node, the node also replicates this block to some other nodes selected randomly (**replication_factor** defines to how many nodes a block should be replicated to). Also, the node stores information about the peer ID of a node which now has this block (current node and replicated nodes) and shares this information with all other nodes in the network. |
| `FileUploadCommit`        | Signals that upload operation is completed providing akave node with file's **root_cid**. Before this operation the file is "invisible": you can't get info about it or download it. After this operation you can't upload more blocks or chunks to this file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `FileDownloadCreate`      | Initiates file download. Fetches the file's metadata and its breakdown on chunks: list of chunks this file is made of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `FileDownloadChunkCreate` | Creates the "download receipt" for a chunk: list of blocks this chunk is made of and from where each block can be downloaded from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `FileDownloadBlock`       | Downloads the block via grpc streaming from a node which address is taken from the response to **FileDownloadChunkCreate**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `FileList`                | Lists all the files in the given bucket. Only file metadata is returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `FileView`                | Fetches the metadata of one particular file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `FileDelete`              | "Soft" deletes the file in a block. The node also shares the information about this operation among all nodes in a network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

> NOTE: Sharing among nodes functionality uses libp2p pubsub. "Soft" deletes mean marking an object with a delete flag in the DB table.

### Akave Node IPC API

The Akave Node IPC API provides access to gRPC service that interacts with Akave node, and IPC deployed smart-contract that operates with metadata.
Uses same File, Bucket, Block and Chunk models as regular Akave Node API

### SDK DAG utilities
- `ChunkDAG` is a struct that contains the node's (in the context of a DAG) meta-information: CID, sizes, block metadata
- `DAGRoot` helps to build the file's root CID. On each file chunk, you have to add a link to the chunk (specifying the chunk's CID and its node sizes)
- `BuildDAG` builds `ChunkDAG` from a given file. This DAG is of flat structure, meaning it has 1 root and all blocks are children of this single root

Encryption key in flag `-e`(or `--encryption-key` in long form) for upload and download file commands is optional, without using it data will be unencrypted. Key must be a hex encoded string.
The key length **must be 32 bytes** long.

Disable erasure coding flag `disable-erasure-coding` ensures that the file is not erasure encoded before being uploaded to the Akave node (erasure coding is enabled by default).

  ```
- **Upload File**: Uploads a file to a specified bucket from the local file system (`-e` is optional, key length **must be 32 bytes** long, `disable-erasure-coding` is optional)
  ```sh
  akavecli files-streaming upload <bucket-name> <file-path> -e="encryption-key" --disable-erasure-coding --node-address=localhost:5000
  ```
- **Download File**: Downloads a file from a specified bucket to the destination folder (`-e` is optional, key length **must be 32 bytes** long, `disable-erasure-coding` is optional)
  ```sh
  akavecli files-streaming download <bucket-name> <file-name> <destination-folder> -e="encryption-key" --disable-erasure-coding --node-address=localhost:5000
  ```
  <small>`<file-name>` here is the last segment in `<file-path>` of the Upload command</small>
  
- **Delete File**: Deletes a specific file.
  ```sh
  akavecli files-streaming delete <bucket-name> <file-name> --node-address=localhost:5000
  ```
  <small>`<file-name>` here is the last segment in `<file-path>` of the Upload command</small>
